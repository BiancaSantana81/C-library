# C-library ðŸ“š

This repository contains the updated version of my libft, originally created as my first project at 42SÃ£oPaulo. In this update, Iâ€™ve added new features and improvements to the library.

# New Features:
- Utility functions to facilitate the development of future projects.
- Improvements to existing functions, with performance optimizations and bug fixes.
- Enhanced Makefile to support new features and improve compilation efficiency.

# Updates: 
This library is continuously evolving as I find improvements and work on more projects. I will keep refining it and adding new features as needed and new requirements arise.
